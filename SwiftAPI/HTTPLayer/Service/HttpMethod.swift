 HTTP methods for RESTful services.

 - get: use it to read data but not change it,
 - post: use it to create new resource,
 - put: use it to update/replace data at known resource URI
 - patch: use it to update data, but request only needs to contain the changes to the resource, not the complete resource.
 - delete: to delete a resource identified by a URI.
